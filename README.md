## Hadns-on tutorial on Machine Learning for USATLAS Campfire

This tutorial is modifed from the the tuorial given by Kehang Bai! (Link: https://github.com/usatlas-ml-training/lbnl-2023/tree/main/intro_tutorial_binary_classifier)

There are two notebooks in this repository, one being the exercise notbook (`intro_NN.ipynb`), one being the solution (`intro_NN_solution.ipynb`). It is encouraged to run the exercise first before looking at the solution. Note that if you would like to dive more into details and more advanced topics on machine learning, please attend the Machine Learning for Fundamental Physics (ML4FP) School 2024.

The US ATLAS Machine Learning Training Program 2023: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1264566/

### Environment requirement

The notebook is very lightweight and can run on both CPU and GPU. One needs to have a python enviornment with the following packages installed:

- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow 2

### Using CERN SWAN to run the tutorial

Below are the instructions of how to run the tutorial on CERN SWAN.

Requirements: CERNBox account

1. First log into CERNBox (https://cernbox.cern.ch) before going to SWAN.
2. Go to https://swan.cern.ch
3. Initialize a session by selecting the default options:

6. This will open a terminal in a new window. In the terminal, git clone the project. To do so, type:
```
git clone https://github.com/jaychan-hep/US-ATLAS-Campfire-ML-Tutorial.git
```

7. Go home by clicking the icon on the top left corner

9. Clck "US-ATLAS-Campfire-ML-Tutorial"
10. Open the notebook "intro_NN.ipynb"

Now you should be able to run the notebook!
