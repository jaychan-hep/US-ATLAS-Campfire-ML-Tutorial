## Hadns-on tutorial on Machine Learning for USATLAS Campfire

There are two notebooks in this repository, one being the exercise notbook (`intro_NN.ipynb`), one being the solution (`intro_NN_solution.ipynb`). It is encouraged to run the exercise first before looking at the solution.

### Environment requirement

The notebook is very lightweight and can run on both CPU and GPU. One needs to have a python enviornment with the following packages installed:

- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow 2
